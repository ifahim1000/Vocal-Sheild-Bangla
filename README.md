# **VocalSheild Bangla: Abusive Speech Detection in Bengali using Whisper**

**VocalSheild Bangla** is a ongoing project built on OpenAI's Whisper model that detects abusive language in Bengali voice recordings. The model transcribes spoken Bengali language into text and identifies potentially harmful or offensive speech content, helping to create a safer communication environment.



## **Project Overview**
**VocalSheild Bangla** leverages the Whisper speech-to-text model to transcribe Bengali voice data into text and runs a custom abusive language detection algorithm on the output. This project is focused on safeguarding Bengali conversations in public forums, social platforms, and personal use, ensuring that offensive or harmful speech is detected.

The project handles:
- **Transcription of Bengali speech**: Using Whisperâ€™s language model.
- **Abusive text detection**: Using pre-trained or custom models for detecting offensive language in Bengali.

## **Prospective Features**
- Accurate **speech-to-text transcription** for Bengali voice recordings.
- **Abusive language detection** in real-time or batch processing.
- **Customizable** to allow training on new abusive language datasets.
- Support for **multiple audio formats** such as `.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.
- **Export results** in text format for further analysis or integration into other systems.
